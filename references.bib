abstract = {Abstract We introduce a new methodology for forecasting, which we call signal diffusion mapping. Our approach accommodates features of real-world financial data which have been ignored historically in existing forecasting methodologies. Our method builds upon well-established and accepted methods from other areas of statistical analysis. We develop and adapt those models for use in forecasting. We also present tests of our model on data in which we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

 abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},
