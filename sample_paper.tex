\subsection{CITATIONS, FIGURES, REFERENCES}


\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
year, e.g., (Cheesman, 1985). References should follow any style that
you are used to using, as long as their style is consistent throughout
the paper.  Be sure that the sentence reads correctly if the citation
is deleted: e.g., instead of ``As described by (Cheesman, 1985), we
first frobulate the widgets,'' write ``As described by Cheesman
(1985), we first frobulate the widgets.''  %Be sure to avoid
%accidentally disclosing author identities through citations.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Use 8 point type for footnotes. Place the
footnotes at the bottom of the column in which their markers appear,
continuing to the next column if required. Precede the footnote
section of a column with a 0.5 point horizontal rule 1~inch (6~picas)
long.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

\subsubsection{Figures}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines
should be very dark for purposes of reproduction, and art work should
not be hand-drawn.  Figures may appear at the top of a column, at the
top of a page spanning multiple columns, inline within a column, or
with text wrapped around them, but the figure number and caption
always appear immediately below the figure.  Leave 2 line spaces
between the figure and the caption. The figure caption is initial caps
and each figure should be numbered consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page rather than
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{.3in}
\centerline{\fbox{This figure intentionally left non-blank}}
\vspace{.3in}
\caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables.
Table number and title always appear above the table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Use one line space before the table title, one line space after the table title,
and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample Table Title} \label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{PART}  &\textbf{DESCRIPTION} \\
\hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Problem Formulation}

\emph{Causal Dynamic Time Lag} is essentially a regression problem with two tasks. Given two time series, 
the causes $x(t)$ and the observed effects $y(t)$, the regression model must learn a mapping $f()$ which
maps each input pattern $x(t_1)$ to an output $y(t_2)$, and a mapping $g()$ which maps the time delay between
the input and output patterns $t_2 = t_1 + g(x(t_1))$. This is formally specified in equations below.

\begin{align}
t & \in \mathbb{R}^{+}\\
x(t) & \in \mathcal{X} \\
f: \mathcal{X} & \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
g: \mathcal{X} & \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}\\
\Delta(t) & = g[x(t)] \\
y(t + \Delta(t)) & = f[x(t)]
\end{align}

\begin{align}
t & \in \mathbb{R}^{+}\\
x(t) & \in \mathcal{X} \\
f: \mathcal{X} & \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
g: \mathcal{X} & \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}\\
\Delta(t) & = g[x(t)] \\
y(t + \Delta(t)) & = f[x(t)]
\end{align}



\section{Proposed Solution}

In practical time-series applications, one works with sub-sampled or discretized versions of the time 
series $x(t)$ and $y(t)$. The time delay function $g(.)$ can now be recast as a function which for every
input pattern $x(t_i)$, returns a time delay $\delta$ corresponding the the time step $t_i + \delta$ when
the effect $y(t_i + \delta)$ is observed.

For practical purposes one must define for every time step $t$, a \emph{causal time window} $[t+\ell, t+\ell+h]$, 
within which the model searches for probable temporal causal links.

Our proposed model then produces the following predictions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Targets $y(t+\ell), \cdots, y(t+\ell+h-1)$
\item Time Lag Probabilities $\hat{p}(t+\ell), \cdots, \hat{p}(t+\ell+h-1)$
\end{enumerate}

The model thus tries to learn a predictor for each lagged output $y(t+i)$ in the 
causal window $[t+\ell, t+\ell+h]$, and simultaneously supplies a probability distribution 
over each time step of the causal window, $\hat{p}(t+i)$.

The distribution $\hat{p}(t+i), i \in {\ell, \cdots, \ell+h-1}$ represents the 
likelihood of a causal link between $x(t)$ and $y(t+i)$. Since the model looks
for causal links in the finite window $[t+\ell, t+\ell+h)$, we have 
$\sum^{\ell+h-1}_{i = \ell}{\hat{p}(t + i)} = 1$.


\section{Loss Function}

In order to train time lag based models, one must balance two incentives.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate accurate predictions for time window $y(t+\ell), \cdots, y(t+\ell+h-1)$
    \item Learn the time lag structure.
\end{enumerate}

These incentives have very different contexts. We have access to measurements of the output
time series $y(t)$, but that is generally not the case for the time lag structure. Although
it is possible that certain data sets may have patterns annotated with time lag information, 
this is not the norm.

We express the loss function as a sum of two terms (equation \ref{eq:loss}). The first; which computes a weighted $L_2$ 
error between the predictions $\hat{y}^{(m)}_{i}$ and the targets $y^{(m)}_{i}$. The second term
$\mathcal{J}(y^{(1:M)}, \hat{y}^{(1:M)}, \hat{p}^{(1:M)})$ must penalize the predicted probabilities
$\hat{p}^{(m)}$ in a meaningful manner, this can be done by considering some \emph{target probability} and
calculating some distance/divergence from such a target.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss}
\begin{aligned}
&\mathcal{L}(y^{(1:M)}, \hat{y}^{(1:M)}, \hat{p}^{(1:M)}) = \\
&\lambda_1 \sum_{i,m}{\frac{1}{2M} (y^{(m)}_{i} - \hat{y}^{(m)}_{i})^2 (1 + \hat{p}^{(m)}_i)} \\ 
&+ \\ 
&\lambda_2 \mathcal{J}(y^{(1:M)}, \hat{y}^{(1:M)}, \hat{p}^{(1:M)})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Target Probability}

From the intuitions of Granger causality, we use the concept of causality as predictability, we can thus characterize the \emph{target probability}, $\widetilde{p}$ for a time window $[t+\ell, t+\ell+h)$ in the following manner: The lagged output $y(t+i)$ which has greater predictability given $x(t)$, is a more likely causal link. This idea is represented in equation \ref{eq:targetprob}, by means of the softmax function and an \emph{annealing temperature} $T$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:targetprob}
\widetilde{p}_{i}^{(m)} = \frac{exp \left( \frac{1}{T} (y_{i}^{(m)} - \hat{y}_{i}^{(m)})^{2} \right)}{\sum_{i}{exp \left( \frac{1}{T} (y_{i}^{(m)} - \hat{y}_{i}^{(m)})^{2} \right)}} 
\end{equation}

The temperature $T$ therefore serves to determine how sharp the target probability distribution is around its peak. The predictions $\hat{y}^{(m)}_{i}$, made by the model are penalized for their divergence from the \emph{target probability} via the \emph{Hellinger distance} metric (equation \ref{eq:hellinger}).


\begin{align}\label{eq:hellinger}
& \mathcal{J}(y^{(1:M)}, \hat{y}^{(1:M)}, \hat{p}^{(1:M)}) = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}{\frac{1}{M} \mathcal{H}(\hat{p}^{(m)}, \widetilde{p}^{(m)})} \\
& \mathcal{H}(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i}{(\sqrt{p_i} -  \sqrt{q_i})^2}}
\end{align}
